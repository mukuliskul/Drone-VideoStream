# Drone with Video Streaming

## Description

Built a drone application with video streaming capabilities. Utilized Pygame for GUI development and the djitellopy library to control the drone. Employed object-oriented programming principles to create a well-structured project. Simplified drone control and video monitoring with keyboard inputs.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Drone Development:** Acquired knowledge and experience in developing applications for drone control and interaction, enabling real-time communication with the Tello drone.

- **Pygame and GUI Development:** Gained proficiency in Pygame library usage for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that enhance user interaction and experience.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Applied OOP principles to design a modular and extensible drone control system, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **API Integration (djitellopy):** Developed skills in integrating external APIs like djitellopy, facilitating seamless communication between the application and the Tello drone.

## Skills

- Drone Development
- Pygame
- GUI Development
- djitellopy
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Use

1. Connect the Tello drone to the application. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Pygame and djitellopy.
2. Run the `main.py` script to start the drone control and video streaming interface.
3. Use the keyboard keys to control the drone's movements:
   - T: Takeoff
   - L: Land
   - Arrow keys: Forward, backward, left, and right movements
   - A and D: Counter-clockwise and clockwise rotations (yaw)
   - W and S: Up and down movements
4. The drone's battery percentage is displayed during the operation.
5. Press the Escape key to quit the application.

Please ensure you have the Tello drone connected and the necessary dependencies installed before running the script.
